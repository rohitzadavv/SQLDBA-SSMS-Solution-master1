```

### 2. BlitzQueries

```
- Check when SQL Services were started
- Check if compatibility Model of databases are up to date
- Ad hoc queries, and m/r settings
- Find queries using DBCC commands inside them
- Find Most Expensive Queries
- Top Queries by Average IO
- Expensive Queries Having Cursor
- Expensive Queries Having Joins to Table-Valued Functions
- Queries with implicit conversion
- Adhoc queries against Database
- Find queries with multiple plans
- Query to examine IO subsystem latencies
- Active tables without clustered index
- Find tables with forwarded records on Single Database
- Find tables with forwarded records on All Databases
- Find Query with Compilation Timeout

### 3. [sp_HealthCheck]

### 4. Custom Log Shipping Script
Log Shipping has many benefits and is often used a Disaster Recovery option. But, If you use Domain Account for SQL Services, then Log Shipping using Custom scripts could be established in much easier way than the default log shipping method. For this purpose, I have created by own Log Shipping procedure [dbo].[usp_DBAApplyTLogs]

<b> [Latest Code of [usp_DBAApplyTLogs]](LogShipping/usp_DBAApplyTLogs.sql)</b>
