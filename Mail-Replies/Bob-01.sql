Seems like we should consider putting the old message archive service back and get a yardstick for performance? Do we have reason to believe it should be doing 100 msgs/sec?

Also, I think it’s probably better if we give DBAs suggestions on something to look at? What servers are we taking about? CMP DB servers? The publisher? Do we have specific metrics from other environments we can compare to? Certain queries we should be monitoring? Any reporting available in the app? If the SQL Server doesn’t show any obvious problems like maxed cpu or long disk queue lengths, can we give them some direction? I’m still an old school believer that most of the time performance issues originate within the application behavior. Sometimes we can compensate for that with DB tuning or throwing hardware at it, sometimes not.
