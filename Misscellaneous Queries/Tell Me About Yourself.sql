Tell Me About Yourself

I have been working with contso as a SQL DBA for past 8 months. 
During this time, apart from Day to Day DBA tasks and client assignments, I have worked on several process improvements and have received multiple appreciations from management and clients for innovation and team work. 

Prior to contso, I have work experience with 3 other Organizations. I started my career with TATA Consultancy Services on various roles like Data Migration Developer, Data Warehouse Developer, and Core SQL DBA. I was lucky to implement few automations there which includes dynamic template creation for Migration, TSQL Query to generate Backup/Restore without using cmdshell, and few other tasks. After 4.3 years with TCS, I later had opportunity to work with Ericsson and United Health Group. In Ericsson I took the responsibility as primary source for Query Performance Issues. Similary I was fortunate enough to save approx 1 million through Space Capacity Automation.

Now, I am looking forward to take my career to the next level with Microsoft as Support Engineer. Within Microsoft, I will aim 'Parnter Technical Consultant' role eventually with next 5 years. Other than the work, I like to share my experience, and help SQL Server Community with technical blogs, answering on QA platform like StackOverflow, SQLServerCentral, facebook etc.
And finally, I love teaching and mentoring, and have been using a YouTube channel to do the same for larger audiance.

Thats all about me. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak about myself.
